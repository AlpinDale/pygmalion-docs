title: Notation

The notations commonly used in Machine Learning are of paramount importance. Knowing how to read mathemetical notations can be the difference between understanding a research paper or leaving it utterly confused. This section will attempt at explaining the commonly used notation systems in ML papers.

<!-- - Random variables or random vectors - both abbreviated as `rvs`  - are represented using roman typeface, while their values and realizations are indicated by the corresponding standard font. For instance, the equality x = $x$ indicates that `rv` x takes value $x$.

- Matrices are indicated using uppercase fonts, with roman typeface used for random matrices.

- Vectors will be taken to be in column form.

- $X^T$ and $X^\dag$ are the transpose and the psuedoinverse of matrix X, respectively.

- The distribution of a `rv` x, either probability mass function (pmf) for a discrete `rv` or probability density function  -->

## Basic Arithmetic Notation

- Addition: $1 + 1 = 2$
- Subtraction: $2 - 1 = 1$
- Multiplication: $2 \cdot 2 = 4$
- Division: $2/2=1$

Basic mathematical operations, as listed above, have a sister operation that performs the inverse operation. For example, subtraction is the inverse of addition, and division is the inverse of multiplication.

## Algebra

Algebra largely deals with variables - data of unknown value - usually represented by Roman or Greek letters. 

#### Multiplication Notation

All of the following can represent multiplication:

- $c = a$ x $b$
- $c = a \cdot b$
- $c = a * b$
- $c = ab$
> A lack of notation represents multiplication.

#### Exponents and roots

An exponent represents a number multiplied by itself $n$ times, where $n$ is the exponent.

- $2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8$

The above is written as `2^3` in plaintext.

Square root is the inverse of an exponent.

- $\sqrt{4} = 2$

This is essentially the expression $2^2 = 4$. A root $\sqrt{}$ with no index is a square root, which can also be written as $\sqrt[2]{}$. In the expression $\sqrt{4}$, we must find a value that, when raised to the power of $2$ (since we're using a *square* root), would give us $4$. This answer is naturally $2$, since $2^2 = 4$.

- $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$

This represents the expression $2^3 = 8$ in root form.

#### Logarithms and `e`

When $10^2 = 10 * 10$ or $100$.
