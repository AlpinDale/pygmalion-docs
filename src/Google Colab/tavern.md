Each Colab notebook will greet you with a guide. For the sake of simplicity, visual guides will be included below. You can find the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TavernAI/TavernAI/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb){target="_blank"}.

- Make sure you're signed in to your Google Account before you attempt running any of the notebooks.
- If you're on mobile, run this cell and keep the audio file playing:

You might be warned that the notebook is not authored by Google - you can ignore it and click on `Run anyway`.
!!!
- Scroll down and run this cell to launch Pygmalion with Tavern:

Choose `Pygmalion Dev` in the `Model` drop-down menu if you want to try the latest beta release of the model.
!!!
- You'll be prompted to give the notebook access to your Google Drive files. Click on `Connect to Google Drive`. This will open a pop-up browser window where you'll give Colab access to your Google Account. **Select the account you wish to use, then scroll down and click on "Allow"**.
- Wait around 5 minutes for TavernAI to finish loading. You can find the URL here at the end:
