`Alt Rep Pen` applies [Repetition Penalty](https://docs.alpindale.dev/pygmalion-docs/settings/repetition_penalty) as a logarithmic modifier rather than a linear modifier. This means that the penalty will be smaller for the first few repetitions and will increase more slowly as the number of repetitions increases. 

In simpler terms, the more your model repeats a token, the more severe the penalty becomes.
