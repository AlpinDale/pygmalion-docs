Each Colab notebook will greet you with a guide. For the sake of simplicity, visual guides will be included below. You can find the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OtisAlejandro/LLMColabs/blob/main/Otis%27_Colab_GPU_(OFFICIAL).ipynb){target="_blank"}.

- Make sure you're signed in to your Google Account before you attempt running any of the notebooks.
- Scroll down and select the highlighted options, and then run the cell:

!!!
You might be warned that the notebook is not authored by Google - you can ignore it and click on `Run anyway`.
!!!
- You'll be prompted to give the notebook access to your Google Drive files. Click on `Connect to Google Drive`. This will open a pop-up browser window where you'll give Colab access to your Google Account. **Select the account you wish to use, then scroll down and click on "Allow"**.
- Wait for the notebook to finish running. This can take up to 5 or 10 minutes.
- Once it's loaded, two URLs will appear. If you wish to use KoboldAI with Tavern, please *copy* the first URL. If you wish to use Kobold by itself, please *click* on the second URL.
