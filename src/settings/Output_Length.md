"Output length" is a setting used to control the length of the output generated by the model. The output length setting will determine how long the Model's reply will be based on the value you set.

For example, if you set the output length to 200, the model will generate a piece of text that is approximately 100 tokens long, depending on the specifics of the model and the input data.

The Output Length setting can be useful for controlling the amount of output generated by the model and for ensuring that the generated text is of a consistent length. A higher value will take longer to generate.
