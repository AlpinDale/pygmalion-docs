# What is PygmalionAI?

PygmalionAI is an open-source `L`arge `L`anguage `M`odel (LLM) based on EleutherAI's [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b). 

In simple terms, Pygmalion is a language AI fine-tuned for chatting and Role-Playing purposes. The current actively supported Pygmalion AI model is the 6B (6 Billion Parameters) model. 

## How do I use Pygmalion?

Language models, including Pygmalion, generally run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), since they need access to fast memory and processing power to output coherent text at an acceptable speed. Pygmalion is no different. You need a powerful GPU to run the model. 

If you don't have a powerful enough GPU, there are luckily alternative solutions. Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) offers free GPUs for all users - though for a limited time. We have ready-made notebooks that you can run to access Pygmalion. You can also use Colab on your mobile phone.

These docs will attempt to explain all the possible methods for running the AI, and in a language that is easy to understand. We will start with Google Colab, as it's generally the easiest method.
