This section is a work in progress, and will be updated regularly.

This section of the docs, though unrelated to Pygmalion, aims to provide an introduction to key concepts, algorithms, and theoretical results in machine learning. The various sections concentrates on transformer and other probabilistic models for supervised and unsupervised learning problems. You will be introduced to fundamental concepts and algorithms by building on first principles, while also being exposed to the literature, within a unified *notation* and mathematical framework. The sections are organized according to clearly defined categories, such as discriminative and generative models, frequentist and Bayesian approaches, exact and approximate inference, as well as directed and undirected models. This part of the docs is meant as an entry point for researchers and learners with a background in probability and linear algebra.
