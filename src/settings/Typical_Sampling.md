`Typical Sampling` is a setting used to control how the model selects the next token or word in the generated output. With typical sampling, the model selects the next token based on its probability distribution, meaning that more probable tokens are more likely to be selected.

For example, if the model is generating a sentence and the next probable word is "the", the model is more likely to select "the" as the next word with typical sampling. This can help to ensure that the generated output is fluent and coherent, as the model is more likely to select words that make sense in the given context.
